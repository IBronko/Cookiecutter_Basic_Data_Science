# Cookiecutter üç™ for a basic data science project

I was tired of manually seeting up a virtual environment and installing the same basic packages/libraries for each (little) project.
Then I stumbled over this tool called "Cookiecutter" that helps me to automate repetition away...

This template can be used in combination with pipenv to set everything up in minutes with just a few commands.

The [pipfile](https://github.com/IBronko/Cookiecutter_Basic_Data_Science/blob/3a6f38ce671009175e7ac73a04905a863c5b8e99/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D/Pipfile) contains the dependencies and can be viewed and adjusted as necessary.
